                                    To keep your Comforty chairs looking like new, we recommend regularly wiping them with a soft cloth. For fabric chairs, use a fabric cleaner or mild detergent to remove stains. For leather or faux leather chairs, use a leather cleaner and conditioner to maintain the material. Regularly check and tighten any screws to ensure stability.
